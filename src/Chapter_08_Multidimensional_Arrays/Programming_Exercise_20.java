/**
 * Game: connect four
 * Connect four is a two-player board game in which the players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, 
 * six-row vertically suspended grid, as shown below. 
 * The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column, or a diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. 
 * The program prompts two players to drop a red or yellow disk alternately. 
 * In the preceding figure, the red disk is shown in a dark color and the yellow in a light color. 
 * Whenever a disk is dropped, the program redisplays the board on the console and determines the status of the game 
 * (win, draw, or continue).
