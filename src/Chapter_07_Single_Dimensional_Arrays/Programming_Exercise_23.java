 * Game: locker puzzle
 * A school has 100 lockers and 100 students. All lockers are closed on the first day of school. 
 * As the students enter, the first student, denoted S1, opens every locker. 
 * Then the second student, S2, begins with the second locker, denoted L2, and closes every other locker. 
 * Student S3 begins with the third locker and changes every third locker (closes it if it was open, and opens it if it was closed). 
 * Student S4 begins with locker L4 and changes every fourth locker. 
 * Student S5 starts with L5 and changes every fifth locker, and so on, until student S100 changes L100. 
 * After all the students have passed through the building and changed the lockers, which lockers are open? 
 * Write a program to find your answer and display all open locker numbers separated by exactly one space.
