/**
 * Algebra: solve quadratic equations
 * Write a method for solving a quadratic equation using the following header: 
 * public static int solveQuadratic(double[] eqn, double[] roots) 
 * The coefficients of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0 are passed to the array eqn and the real roots are stored in roots. 
 * The method returns the number of real roots. 
 * See Programming Exercise 3.1 on how to solve a quadratic equation. 
 * Write a program that prompts the user to enter values for a, b, and c and displays the number of real roots and all real roots.
