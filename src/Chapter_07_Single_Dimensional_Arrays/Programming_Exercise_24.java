/**
 * Simulation: coupon collector’s problem
 * Coupon collector is a classic statistics problem with many practical applications. 
 * The problem is to pick objects from a set of objects repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed for all the objects to be picked at least once. 
 * A variation of the problem is to pick cards from a shuffled deck of 52 cards repeatedly and find out how many picks are needed before you see one of each suit. 
 * Assume a picked card is placed back in the deck before picking another. 
 * Write a program to simulate the number of picks needed to get four cards from each suit and display the four cards picked 
 * (it is possible a card may be picked twice).
