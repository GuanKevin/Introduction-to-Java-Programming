/**
 * Game: ATM machine
 * Use the Account class created in Programming Exercise 9.7 to simulate an ATM machine. 
 * Create ten accounts in an array with id 0, 1, . . . , 9, and initial balance $100. 
 * The system prompts the user to enter an id. 
 * If the id is entered incorrectly, ask the user to enter a correct id. 
 * Once an id is accepted, the main menu is displayed as shown in the sample run. 
 * You can enter a choice 1 for viewing the current balance, 2 for withdrawing money, 3 for depositing money, and 4 for exiting the main menu. 
 * Once you exit, the system will prompt for an id again. Thus, once the system starts, it will not stop.
