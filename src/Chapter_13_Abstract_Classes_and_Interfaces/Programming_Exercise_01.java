/**
 * Triangle class
 * Design a new Triangle class that extends the abstract GeometricObject class.
 * Implement the Triangle class. 
 * Write a test program that prompts the user to enter three sides of the triangle, a color, and a Boolean value to indicate whether the triangle is filled. 
 * The program should create a Triangle object with these sides and set the color and filled properties using the input. 
 * The program should display the area, perimeter, color, and true or false to indicate whether it is filled or not.
