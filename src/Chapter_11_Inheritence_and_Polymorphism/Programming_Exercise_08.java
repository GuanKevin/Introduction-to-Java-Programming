/**
 * New Account class
 * An Account class was specified in Programming Exercise 9.7. Design a new Account class as follows:
 * Add a new data field name of the String type to store the name of the customer.
 * Add a new constructor that constructs an account with the specified name, id, and balance.
 * Add a new data field named transactions whose type is ArrayList that stores the transaction for the accounts. 
 * Each transaction is an instance of the Transaction class. 
 * Modify the withdraw and deposit methods to add a transaction to the transactions array list.
 * All other properties and methods are the same as in Programming Exercise 9.7. 
 * Write a test program that creates an Account with annual interest rate 1.5%, balance 1000, id 1122, and name George. 
 * Deposit $30, $40, and $50 to the account and withdraw $5, $4, and $2 from the account. 
 * Print an account summary that shows account holder name, interest rate, balance, and all transactions.
