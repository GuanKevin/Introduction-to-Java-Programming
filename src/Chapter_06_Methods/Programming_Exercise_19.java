/**
 * The MyTriangle class
 * Create a class named MyTriangle that contains the following two methods:
 * Return true if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. 
 * public static boolean isValid(double side1, double side2, double side3)
 * public static double area(double side1, double side2, double side3) 
 * Write a test program that reads three sides for a triangle and computes the area if the input is valid. 
 * Otherwise, it displays that the input is invalid. 
 * The formula for computing the area of a triangle is given in Programming Exercise 2.19.
