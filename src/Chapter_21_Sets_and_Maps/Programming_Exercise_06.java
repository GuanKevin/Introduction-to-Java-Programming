/**
 * Count the occurrences of numbers entered
 * Write a program that reads an unspecified number of integers and finds the one that has the most occurrences. 
 * The input ends when the input is 0. For example, if you entered 2 3 40 3 5 4 –3 
 * 3 3 2 0, the number 3 occurred most often. If not one but several numbers have the most occurrences, 
 * all of them should be reported. For example, since 9 and 3 appear 
 * twice in the list 9 30 3 9 3 2 4, both occurrences should be reported.
