/**
 * The Stock class
 * Following the example of the Circle class in Section 9.2, design a class named Stock that contains:
 * A string data field named symbol for the stock’s symbol.
 * A string data field named name for the stock’s name.
 * A double data field named previousClosingPrice that stores the stock price for the previous day.
 * A double data field named currentPrice that stores the stock price for the current time.
 * A constructor that creates a stock with the specified symbol and name.
 * A method named getChangePercent() that returns the percentage changed from previousClosingPrice to currentPrice.s
 * Write a test program that creates a Stock object with the stock symbol ORCL, the name Oracle Corporation, 
 * and the previous closing price of 34.5. 
 * Set a new current price to 34.35 and display the price-change percentage.
