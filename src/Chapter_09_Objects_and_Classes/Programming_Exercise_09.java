/**
 * Geometry: n-sided regular polygon
 * In an n-sided regular polygon, all sides have the same length and all angles have the same degree 
 * (i.e., the polygon is both equilateral and equiangular). 
 * Design a class named RegularPolygon that contains:
 * A private int data field named n that defines the number of sides in the polygon with default value 3.
 * A private double data field named side that stores the length of the side with default value 1.
 * A private double data field named x that defines the x-coordinate of the polygon’s center with default value 0.
 * A private double data field named y that defines the y-coordinate of the polygon’s center with default value 0.
 * A no-arg constructor that creates a regular polygon with default values.
 * A constructor that creates a regular polygon with the specified number of sides and length of side, centered at (0, 0).
 * A constructor that creates a regular polygon with the specified number of sides, length of side, and x- and y-coordinates.
 * The accessor and mutator methods for all data fields.
 * The method getPerimeter() that returns the perimeter of the polygon.
 * The method getArea() that returns the area of the polygon.
 * Write a test program that creates three RegularPolygon objects, 
 * created using the no-arg constructor, using RegularPolygon(6, 4), and using RegularPolygon(10, 4, 5.6, 7.8). 
 * For each object, display its perimeter and area.
